# Tyre-Temperature-Simulator
## Overview

The Tyre Temperature Simulator is a robust analysis tool designed to model the thermal behaviour of tyres during a race. By accounting for parameters such as load, track temperature, driving style, and compound-specific properties, the simulator predicts tyre temperature trends and their impact on performance.

This tool is particularly valuable for motorsport teams looking to optimise tyre management strategies in both qualifying and race conditions. Using advanced modelling, it evaluates heat build-up, dissipation, and their effects on grip and durability.

## Features

- **Dynamic Temperature Modelling**: Simulates tyre heat build-up and cooling under variable loads and conditions.
- **Compound-Specific Behaviour**: Models thermal properties for different tyre compounds.
- **Driving Style Adjustment**: Incorporates aggressive or conservative driving impacts on temperature.
- **Heat Dissipation Analysis**: Evaluates cooling effects from airflow and track surface.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generates detailed plots of temperature profiles and performance metrics.
